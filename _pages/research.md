# • Modeling perceptual decision-making mechanism considering the multilayered structure of the cortex

Ongoing. Will be updated.

# • A computational model for the microcircuitry of the cortical laminar architecture 

We simplified the cortical column model in the paper "Large-scale model of mammalian thalamocortical systems" (E. M. Izhikevich, G. M. Edelman)
We excluded the active synaptic compartments and introduced biologically plausible delays and attenuations. Also, we excluded the dopamine-modulated STDP since our simulation work-station is not much powerful. We write the codes in Brian2, and we will hopefully publish the code here soon.

# • Implementing the perceptual decision-making mechanism model in "Probabilistic Decision Making by Slow Reverberation in Cortical Circuits" by X-J. Wang (2002) with Brian2

This project is done, results and codes will be added.

# • Implementing the cortex model in the "Simple model of spiking neurons" paper by E. M. Izhikevich (2003) with Brian2

One thousand randomly connected neurons are simulated.
