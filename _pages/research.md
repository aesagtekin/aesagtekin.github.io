Abstract
<br> <br>
Reinforcement learning (RL) framework provides experimentally justified explanations for
animal learning. On the other hand, animal learning has been extensively associated with synaptic
plasticity, which is commonly studied by employing spiking neural networks in computational
neuroscience literature. In this report, I investigate the literature that explores the relationship
between synaptic plasticity rules and the RL framework. The literature can be divided into three
parts: 1) using policy-gradient methods to analytically derive plasticity rules, 2) modulating the
STDP rule by a global reward signal, and 3) using temporal-difference learning to find plasticity
rules.

Take-home Messages
<br> <br>
• Training spiking neural networks on simple discrimination tasks shapes the neural tuning curve of the upstream neuron. <br>
• A simple selectivity task leads to E/I anti-tuning, and also to E/I balance if a constraint is put on the post-synaptic firing rate. <br>
• A novelty selectivity task is much harder to train, but leads to E/I co- tuning. <br>
