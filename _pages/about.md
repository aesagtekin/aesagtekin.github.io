I graduated in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Istanbul Technical University (ITU). I will be at the University of Tübingen for my master's degree in Computational Neuroscience. 

I'm mainly interested in biological neural networks, biophysical modeling, dynamical systems theory, and stochastic modeling.

During my bachelor's thesis, I worked on multilayered modeling of cortex with spiking neuron models under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Neslihan Serap Şengör at the [ITU Neuroscience Modelling and Research Group](https://www.simmag.itu.edu.tr/).
