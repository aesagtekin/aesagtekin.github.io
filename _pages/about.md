I'm currently doing my master's in computational neuroscience at the University of TÃ¼bingen, funded by DAAD. I have a bachelor's degree in Electronics & Communication Engineering from Istanbul Technical University. 
<br>
My main research focus is plasticity rules. I see two seemingly distinct but inherently coupled benefits in studying plasticity rules. From a scientific perspective, I believe it will eventually help us understand the mechanisms of learning and memory in the animal brain. From an engineering perspective, it may provide further insights into developing efficient learning methods for machines.
<br>
Currently as a part of my master's studies, I am doing my lab rotation in [Macke lab](https://www.mackelab.org), studying on a project "Fitting RNNs to spikes with variational generalised teacher forcing". Before that, I have done my essay rotation in [Dayan lab](https://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/computational-neuroscience) writing a literature review on "Reinforcement learning in biological neural networks". During my first year of master's, I worked on "Emergent E/I tuning and balance during surrogate gradient learning" in [Levina lab](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/self-organization-and-optimality-in-neuronal-networks/), which I presented a poster in Bernstein Conference. I have done my bachelor's thesis with Neslihan Serap Sengor in [Sengor lab](https://www.simmag.itu.edu.tr), working in spiking neural networks that realizes perceptual-decision making. I am utterly grateful for her guidance through my whole bachelor's, and for making me realize the beauty in math and neuroscience.
