I'm currently a researcher in Flatiron Institute, co-supervised by Alex Williams and Cristina Savin. I work on metrics for dynamic representations. I have an MSc degree in Computational Neuroscience from the University of Tübingen, where I was funded by the German Academic Excellence Service (DAAD). I have a bachelor's degree in Electronics & Communication Engineering from Istanbul Technical University.  
<br> 
My research focus is learning, computation through dynamics, and latent variable models. In general, I approach neuroscience questions using modern machine learning tools and dynamical systems theory.  
<br>
I completed my master's thesis in [Savin Lab](https://csavin.wixsite.com/savinlab) at NYU CNS (Center for Neural Science), where I combined control and learning theory to develop a novel algorithm for recurrent neural networks (in preparation). During my second lab rotation, I worked in [Macke Lab](https://www.mackelab.org), on a project about inferring dynamical systems underlying data. Before that, I did my first lab rotation in [Dayan Lab](https://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/computational-neuroscience), working on three-factor Hebbian learning. During my first year of the master's program, I worked on learning rules in [Levina Lab](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/self-organization-and-optimality-in-neuronal-networks/). I completed my bachelor's thesis with Neslihan Serap Şengör in [Şengör Lab](https://www.simmag.itu.edu.tr), working on spiking neural networks implementing a perceptual-decision-making task. I am utterly grateful for her guidance throughout my whole bachelor's and for making me realize the beauty in math and neuroscience.
