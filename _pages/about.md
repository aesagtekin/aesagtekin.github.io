I'm currently in [Savin lab](https://csavin.wixsite.com/savinlab) at NYU CNS (Center for Neural Science) for my master's thesis. I've been doing my master's in computational neuroscience at the University of TÃ¼bingen, funded by DAAD. I have a bachelor's degree in Electronics & Communication Engineering from Istanbul Technical University. 
<br> <br>
My research focus is learning, computation through dynamics and latent variable models. In general, I approach neuroscience questions using modern machine learning tools and dynamical systems theory.
<br> <br>
I worked in [Macke lab](https://www.mackelab.org), on a project about inferring dynamical systems underlying data. Before that, I have done my lab rotation in [Dayan lab](https://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/computational-neuroscience) working on three-factor Hebbian learning. During my first year of master's, I worked on learning rules in [Levina lab](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/self-organization-and-optimality-in-neuronal-networks/). I have done my bachelor's thesis with Neslihan Serap Sengor in [Sengor lab](https://www.simmag.itu.edu.tr), working on spiking neural networks implementing perceptual-decision making task. I am utterly grateful for her guidance through my whole bachelor's, and for making me realize the beauty in math and neuroscience.
