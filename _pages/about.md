I graduated in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Istanbul Technical University (ITU). I will be at the University of Tübingen for my master's in Neural Information Processing - Computational Neuroscience degree. I'm mainly interested in biological neural networks, biophysical modeling, and dynamical systems theory.

During my bachelor's thesis, I worked on multilayered modeling of cortex with spiking neuron models under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Neslihan Serap Şengör at the [ITU Neuroscience Modelling and Research Group](https://www.simmag.itu.edu.tr/).

My ultimate goal is to take a step toward getting a better understanding of the brain with the help of math and simulations.
