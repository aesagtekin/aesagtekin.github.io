I am a neuroscience graduate student in the [Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu) at Columbia University. My research focus is artificial and biological learning and computation.
<br> <br>
Before starting my PhD, I worked at the Flatiron Institute in the [NeuroStatsLab](https://neurostatslab.org), co-supervised by Alex Williams and Cristina Savin, where I worked on metrics for comparing dynamic representations. I completed my master’s thesis in the [Savin Lab](https://csavin.wixsite.com/savinlab) at NYU’s Center for Neural Science, combining control and learning theory to develop a novel algorithm for training recurrent neural networks. Earlier, I completed lab rotations in the [Macke Lab](https://www.mackelab.org) on inferring the dynamical systems underlying data and in the [Dayan Lab](https://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/computational-neuroscience) on three-factor Hebbian learning. During my bachelor’s degree, I worked with Neslihan Serap [Şengör](https://www.simmag.itu.edu.tr) on spiking neural networks for perceptual decision-making. I am deeply grateful for her mentorship since my undergraduate years, she not only guided my research but also helped me appreciate the beauty of mathematics and neuroscience.
