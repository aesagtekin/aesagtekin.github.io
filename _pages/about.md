I'm senior undergraduate student in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Istanbul Technical University (ITU). I'm mainly interested in biological neural networks, biophysical modeling, and dynamical systems theory.

Most recently, I work on multilayered modeling of cortex. My ultimate research goal is investigating the neural dynamics with detailed biologically plausible models. I work on under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Neslihan Serap Şengör, at the [ITU Neuroscience Modelling and Research Group](https://www.simmag.itu.edu.tr/).
