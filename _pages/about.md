I'm currently a researcher at the Flatiron Institute, co-supervised by Alex Williams and Cristina Savin, working on metrics for comparing dynamic representations. I have an MSc degree in Computational Neuroscience from the University of Tübingen, where I was funded by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), and I did my bachelor's in Electronics & Communication Engineering at Istanbul Technical University.
<br> <br> 
My research focus is learning, computation through dynamics, and latent variable models. In general, I approach neuroscience questions using modern machine learning tools and dynamical systems theory.  
<br>
I completed my master's thesis in [Savin Lab](https://csavin.wixsite.com/savinlab) at NYU’s Center for Neural Science, where I combined control and learning theory to develop a novel algorithm for recurrent neural networks (currently in preparation). Before that, I worked in [Macke Lab](https://www.mackelab.org), on inferring dynamical systems underlying data. My first lab rotation was in [Dayan Lab](https://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/computational-neuroscience), where I explored three-factor Hebbian learning. During my first year of the master's program, I also worked on learning rules in [Levina Lab](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/self-organization-and-optimality-in-neuronal-networks/). For my bachelor's thesis, I worked with Neslihan Serap [Şengör](https://www.simmag.itu.edu.tr), on spiking neural networks for perceptual decision-making. I am deeply grateful for her mentorship since my undergraduate years, as she not only guided my research but also helped me appreciate the beauty of math and neuroscience.
